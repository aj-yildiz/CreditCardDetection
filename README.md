# CreditCardDetection

Overview

This project focuses on credit card fraud detection using machine learning techniques. The dataset comes from the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset. The dataset contains anonymized credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent (1) or non-fraudulent (0). Due to extreme class imbalance, specialized techniques such as SMOTE, undersampling, and balanced models were used.

Features
**
Data Preprocessing:**

  Normalization and scaling using RobustScaler

  Handling class imbalance with SMOTE and random undersampling

**Machine Learning Models:
**
  Logistic Regression

  Random Forest

  Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, GBC)

  Support Vector Machine (SVM)

  Neural Network (TensorFlow/Keras)

**Model Evaluation:**

  Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

  Handling false positives vs. false negatives

  Performance comparison across multiple models
